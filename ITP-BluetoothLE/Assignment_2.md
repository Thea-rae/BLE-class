## Assignment 2 - Build a Bluetooth LE Phone App

Use PhoneGap and the [Cordova BLE Central Plugin](https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central) API to create a phone app for the peripheral you built in the [first assignment](Assignment_1.md). The application does not need to be complex. You can use the [examples from class](/phonegap) as a basis for your project.

You must include

 * Description of your project
 * Screenshots of the app
 * Source code for the app
 * Optional: Short (< 20 second) video of app interacting with the peripheral

If you use Github or Bitbucket, submit a link to the project. Alternately you can submit a zip file of your work. Submit all work via [email](mailto:dc159@nyu.edu).

You can use [PhoneGap Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com) or [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io) if you need additional plugins.

Due Date:
The first version of your app is *due* before class on *February 19th*.

You'll have the opportunity to revise your project and submit the *final version* of you peripheral and app by *February 22*.
